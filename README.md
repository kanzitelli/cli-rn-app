> Currently in very `alpha` stage and under heavy testing. Available for iOS only.

Purpose of this [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) App and [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn) is to simplify and accelerate the process of app development.

*cli-rn app* will help you to test your RN apps in `DEV` and `PROD` modes in record times. You can think of it as a *very* simplified Expo client with [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).

### Installation on iOS
Install [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn) and generate *cli-rn app*
```
> npm i -g cli-rn
> cli-rn app
```
It will start generating *cli-rn app* and in the end of the process, XCode will opened and you will need to launch the app on your device in **Release** mode.

### App Interface
Once you start testing, you will get `App Code` generated by [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn). You will need to put this code in the text input you see on the screenshot below. Don't forget to choose the correct app mode.

### Things to be aware of
- While testing an app in any mode, you will see the black screen after running the app. It's totally okay as I haven't found a way to manage it yet. It means that your app started loading.
- **`DEV` mode**: black screen can hang for a while if you run it for the first time. You can check the progress of loading in terminal window where Metro Bundler is running.
- **`DEV` mode**: you can shake the device and it will reload the bundle with added code.
- **`DEV` mode**: **no fast-refresh** yet.

### Testing
For more information about testing process and cli itself, please follow [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn) page.
